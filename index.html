   <h2>TangleJS: A Tiny Game Library</h2>
   <p>Tangle is my contribution to the growing pile of small, lightweight HTML5 game libraries. 
     It's mostly shared here as an educational effort, in conjunction with the 
     <a href="http://www.buyog.com/code/search.php?tag=lmacl">Let's Make a Canvas Library</a> 
     series on my blog, and in accordance with the principles outlined in 
     <a href="www.buyog.com/talks/utahjs">this presentation</a> I gave at UtahJS in June 2012.</p>
   
   <h3>Modules</h3>
   <p>Tangle is built upon the <a href="https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD">Asynchronous Module Definition API</a>,
     commonly referred to as AMD. This means that script dependencies are taken care of more or less for free, 
     and we don't need a separate preloading step to bootstrap our JavaScript code for us (other than an 
     <a href="requirejs.org">AMD-compatible</a> <a href="https://github.com/cujojs/curl">loader</a>, of course).</p>
   
   <p>Tangle leverages some basic cross-browser functionality provided by <a href="https://github.com/buyog/atto">Atto</a>, 
     my minimal JavaScript library. As some point I may copy those dependent portions of Atto in here to make this library 
     self-contained, but that isn't a priority at this time (remember, this library is educational in nature, not 
     production-ready).</p>
   
   <p>Beyond script module loading, this project aims to provide many of the basic building blocks for making a game 
     (or other interactive experience) in HTML5: sprite sheets and animations, stage backgrounds and viewports, 
     music and sounds, state management, and so on. However, unlike game frameworks such as 
     <a href="http://impactjs.com/">Impact.js</a> and <a href=""></a>, there's no "one right way" to use Tangle. As such,
     it's not as easy to get started as with those guys, but instead you get a handful of discrete functional modules 
     to make your coding life easier, and the flexibility to use them however you want.</p>
   
   <p>Tangle is still a work in progress. Eventually it will include some or all of these things 
     (examples are hyperlinked where available):</p>
   <ul>
     <li><a href="tut/part2.html">Asset Cache</a> (image/audio file preloader)</li>
     <li><a href="tut/part3.html">State Manager</a></li>
     <li>Game loop</li>
     <li>Sprite</li>
     <li>Collision detection</li>
     <li>Physics engine</li>
     <li>Map</li>
     <li>Screen (viewport-sized subsection of a Map)</li>
     <li>SoundEffect</li>
     <li>Music</li>
     <li>Font</li>
     <li>etc...</li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>It is likely that this module list will evolve over the course of the blog series, so check back often.</p>
